2. **Series A**: $10-20M (after Seed)
3. **Series B**: $30-50M (after Series A)

#### Valuation Factors
- Current MRR (10x ARR base)
- Monthly growth rate (>20% = +50% valuation)
- Product maturity (>70% = +20% valuation)

- **Great (15% chance)**: Founder-friendly, 20% less equity, 20% more capital

#### Equity Cap
- Maximum 30% dilution per round

### 7. Acquisition Offers

#### When They Happen

#### Offer Calculation
- 3-6x annual revenue
- Modified by due diligence quality
- Your payout = offer × your equity %

#### Decision
- Accept: Game ends, you win!
- Decline: Keep building

### 8. Win/Loss Conditions

#### Game Over
- **Run out of cash**: Shut down
- **60 months pass**: Final scoring
