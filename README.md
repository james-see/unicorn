## Nutshell

You start out as a VC with $250,000 USD. Your goal is to invest and make as much money as you can by the end of 10 years. Each turn 1 month of time passes, things happen that you can't control, and you have to make decisions based on the limited information that you have at the time.

## Future Plans

Game mode - run as a startup, your goal is to become a Unicorn and exit.
