## Nutshell

**TWO GAME MODES:**

### 🎩 VC Investor Mode (Classic)
You manage a realistic VC fund ($500K-$1M) competing against AI investors like CARL from Sterling & Cooper! Over 5 years (60 turns), navigate multiple funding rounds, manage dilution, and pay 2% annual management fees while building your portfolio. Each month brings events, company funding rounds, and competitive rankings. Will you beat the AI VCs and become the top investor?

### 🚀 Startup Founder Mode (NEW!)

Make strategic decisions about product development, marketing, hiring, partnerships, and more. Can you grow to $20M ARR and IPO? Or will you get acquired along the way?
