## üåç Global Expansion

Launch your product in international markets to access new customers.

### Available Markets

| Region | Setup Cost | Monthly Cost | Market Size | Competition |
|--------|-----------|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| Europe | $200k | $30k | 50,000 | High |
| Asia | $250k | $40k | 100,000 | Very High |

## üíé Investor Equity Buybacks

Buy back equity from investors when you're profitable.

### Requirements
- ‚úÖ Must be profitable (MRR > Monthly Team Cost)
- ‚úÖ Must have completed at least one funding round
- ‚úÖ Must have sufficient cash for buyback

### Buyback Mechanics
- **Valuation**: 12x ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue)
- **Cost**: Current Valuation √ó Equity % √∑ 100
- **Limit**: Can only buy back equity from rounds where you raised money
- **Max**: Can't buy back more than investors own in that round

### Example Calculation
```
Current MRR: $100,000
Annual Revenue: $1,200,000
Valuation: $1,200,000 √ó 12 = $14,400,000

Buying back 5% from Seed investors:
Cost = $14,400,000 √ó 5% = $720,000

Your new ownership: (100% - Given Away + Bought Back)
```

### Strategic Timing
- **Best Time**: After reaching profitability, before next funding round
- **Sweet Spot**: High cash reserves + strong MRR
- **Avoid**: When you need cash for growth initiatives

### Benefits
- Increase your ownership percentage
- Reduce investor influence
- Improve exit economics
- Demonstrate confidence in your business

## üëî Board & Equity Pool Management

Manage your board composition and employee equity allocation.

### Board Seats

#### Adding Board Seats
- **Cost**: ~2% from employee equity pool (1.5-2.5%)
- **Reason**: Strategic advisor, industry expert, investor representative
- **Impact**: Reduces equity pool available for employee grants
- **Starting**: Founders begin with 1 board seat

#### When to Add
- Raising funding (investors often require board seat)
- Bringing on strategic advisors
- Regulatory/compliance requirements
- Industry expertise needed

### Employee Equity Pool

#### Current State
- **Starting Pool**: 10% reserved for employees
- **Used For**: Employee stock options, key hire incentives
- **Tracked Separately**: From founder and investor equity

#### Expanding the Pool
- **Range**: Can add 1-10% at once
- **Cost**: Dilutes founder's equity
- **Purpose**: Attract/retain top talent
- **Typical Additions**: 5% per major hiring push

### Equity Management Strategy

#### Early Stage (Months 1-12)
- Preserve equity pool for first key hires
- Limit board seats to founders + lead investor
- Focus on product development over equity management

#### Growth Stage (Months 13-36)
- Expand pool as you scale hiring
- Add strategic board members
- Consider buybacks if profitable

#### Late Stage (Months 37-60)
- Buyback investor equity if possible
- Optimize board for exit strategy
- Ensure sufficient pool for retention

### Equity Breakdown Example
```
Initial State:
- Founders: 90%
- Employee Pool: 10%
- Investors: 0%

After Seed Round (20% dilution):
- Founders: 72%
- Employee Pool: 8%
- Investors: 20%

After Pool Expansion (+5%):
- Founders: 67%
- Employee Pool: 13%
- Investors: 20%

After Series A (25% dilution):
- Founders: 50.25%
- Employee Pool: 9.75%
