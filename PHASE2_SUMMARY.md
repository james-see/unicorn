# Phase 2 Implementation Complete! ??

## What Was Implemented

### ? Database & Persistence

1. **SQLite Database Integration**
   - Local database file: `unicorn_scores.db`
   - Automatic table creation on first run
   - Indexed for fast queries on net worth, ROI, player name, and difficulty
   - Graceful degradation if database fails

2. **Score Tracking System**
   - Every completed game is automatically saved
   - Tracks:
     - Player name
     - Final net worth
     - ROI percentage
     - Successful exits (5x+ returns)
     - Turns played
     - Difficulty level
     - Timestamp

### ? Difficulty Levels

**4 Difficulty Levels:**

| Difficulty | Starting Cash | Event Freq | Volatility | Max Turns | Description |
|-----------|--------------|------------|------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Easy** | $500,000 | 20% | 3% | 120 | More cash, fewer events, lower risk |
| **Medium** | $250,000 | 30% | 5% | 120 | Balanced challenge |
| **Hard** | $150,000 | 40% | 7% | 120 | Less cash, more volatility |
| **Expert** | $100,000 | 50% | 10% | 90 | Brutal - only 7.5 years! |

**Difficulty affects:**
- Starting capital amount
- Frequency of random events
- Market volatility (natural price swings)
- Game duration (Expert mode is shorter)

### ? Leaderboard System

1. **By Net Worth (All)** - Top 10 highest final net worth across all difficulties
2. **By ROI (All)** - Top 10 highest return on investment
3. **Easy Difficulty** - Top 10 for Easy mode
4. **Medium Difficulty** - Top 10 for Medium mode
5. **Hard Difficulty** - Top 10 for Hard mode
6. **Expert Difficulty** - Top 10 for Expert mode
7. **Recent Games** - Last 10 games played

- Sector performance tracking
- Economic cycle indicators

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Each Difficulty:**
   - Play one game on each level
   - Verify different starting cash
   - Confirm event frequencies feel different
   - Check leaderboard separation works

2. **Test Persistence:**
   - Play multiple games
   - Verify scores appear on leaderboards
   - Check stats accumulate correctly
   - Test sorting (net worth vs ROI)

3. **Test Edge Cases:**
   - Empty leaderboards (first run)
