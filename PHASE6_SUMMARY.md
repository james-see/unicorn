# Phase 6 - Realistic VC Fund Simulation

## Overview
This phase transforms the game into a realistic VC fund simulation with management fees, multiple funding rounds, dilution mechanics, and AI competitors. Players now compete against computer-controlled VCs while managing a proper fund with all the realistic complexities of venture capital.

## Major Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Fund Structure ??
**Files Modified**: `game/game.go`, `main.go`

- **Larger, Realistic Fund Sizes**:
  - Easy: $1,000,000 (was $500k)
  - Medium: $750,000 (was $250k)
  - Hard: $500,000 (was $150k)
  - Expert: $500,000 (was $100k)

- **2% Annual Management Fee**:
  - Charged monthly (1/12 of annual rate)
  - Deducted from cash reserves
  - Displayed throughout game
  - Tracked in `Portfolio.ManagementFeesCharged`
  - Applied to both player and AI competitors

### 2. Multiple Funding Rounds ??
**Files Modified**: `game/game.go`

- **Automated Round Scheduling**:
  - Seed Round (6-12 months): Raises ~10% of valuation
  - Series A (18-36 months): Raises ~20% of valuation
  - Series B (36-60 months): Raises ~33% of valuation
  - Series C (60-90 months): Raises ~50% of valuation (50% of companies)

- **FundingRound Struct**:
  ```go
  type FundingRound struct {
      RoundName        string
      PreMoneyVal      int64
      InvestmentAmount int64
      PostMoneyVal     int64
      Month            int
  }
  ```

- **Post-Money Valuation Calculation**:
  - Formula: `Post-Money = Pre-Money + Investment`
  - Realistic VC math applied

### 3. Dilution Mechanics ??
**Files Modified**: `game/game.go`, `main.go`

- **Automatic Dilution Calculation**:
  - Formula: `New Equity = Old Equity ? (Pre-Money / Post-Money)`
  - Applied to all existing investors when company raises new round
  - Both player and AI investors affected

- **Enhanced Investment Tracking**:
  ```go
  type Investment struct {
      EquityPercent    float64  // Current equity after dilution
      InitialEquity    float64  // Original equity preserved
      Rounds           []FundingRound  // All rounds tracked
      // ... other fields
  }
  ```

- **Dilution Notifications**:
  - News messages when dilution occurs
  - Shows before/after equity percentages
  - Example: "Company raised $5M in Series A! Your equity diluted from 5.00% to 3.33%"

### 4. AI Competitor System ??
**Files Modified**: `game/game.go`, `main.go`

- **Three AI Players with Distinct Strategies**:

  1. **CARL** (Sterling & Cooper):
     - Strategy: Conservative
     - Risk Tolerance: 30%
     - Behavior: Focuses on low-risk companies with proven metrics
  
  2. **Sarah Chen** (Accel Partners):
     - Strategy: Aggressive
     - Risk Tolerance: 80%
     - Behavior: Chases high-growth moonshots
  
  3. **Marcus Williams** (Sequoia Capital):
     - Strategy: Balanced
     - Risk Tolerance: 50%
     - Behavior: Diversified risk approach

- **AI Investment Logic**:
  - Invests in 3-6 companies at game start
  - Decision-making based on:
    - Strategy type (conservative/aggressive/balanced)
    - Company risk scores
    - Growth potential
  - Capital allocation varies by strategy

- **AI Portfolio Management**:
  - Subject to same events as player
  - Affected by dilution in same way
  - Pays management fees
  - Portfolios update each turn

### 5. Competitive Leaderboard System ??
**Files Modified**: `game/game.go`, `main.go`

- **PlayerScore Type**:
  ```go
  type PlayerScore struct {
      Name     string
      Firm     string
      NetWorth int64
      ROI      float64
      IsPlayer bool
  }
  ```

- **During Game**:
  - Mini-leaderboard every quarter (3 months)
  - Shows current standings
  - Displays net worth and ROI
  - Highlights player position

- **Final Results**:
  - Complete leaderboard at game end
  - Rankings by net worth
  - Color-coded positions (1st=Gold, 2nd=Cyan, 3rd=Green)
  - Victory/defeat message based on final rank
  - Example output:
    ```
    RANK  INVESTOR              FIRM                  NET WORTH    ROI
    1     Marcus Williams       Sequoia Capital       $2,145,000   114.5%
    2     Your Name ? YOU       Your Fund             $1,987,500   98.8%
    ```

3. **Dilution Planning**: Understand that equity will decrease over time
4. **Competitive Pressure**: Must outperform AI to win
5. **Strategy Selection**: Learn from AI behavior patterns

### Game Balance:
- All players (human + AI) subject to same rules
- Fair competition on level playing field
- Different AI strategies create varied outcomes
- Management fees affect everyone equally
